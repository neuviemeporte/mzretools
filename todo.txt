- mark null blocks as bad/unreachable in mzmap - runs of 0000/add [bx+si],al probably don't make sense in legitimate code
- after making compare blocks more granular, probably stack offsets mapping within routine is lost when jumping to new queue item? need to preserve those
- add segments to routine map constructor, trace current segment, place unclaimed blocks in current rather than load segment
- OMF parser, extract segments, function signatures etc
- add load() call to mzimage constructor, will probably break tests

- add segments to routine map constructor, trace current segment, place unclaimed blocks in current rather than load segment
- OMF parser, extract segments, function signatures etc
- dn1 0x24f6 loop?
- overwrite queue item when creating fall-through branch?
- add load() call to mzimage constructor, will probably break tests
